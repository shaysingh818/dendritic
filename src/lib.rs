//! # Dendritic Machine Learning Crate
//!
//! Dendritic is a machine learning library for the Rust ecosystem.
//! This crate contains your standard machine learning algorithms and utilities for numerical computation.
//! There are multiple subcrates within this project that can be used to build machine learning models
//!
//! ## Disclaimer
//! The dendritic project is a toy machine learning library built for learning and research purposes.
//! It is not advised by the maintainer to use this library as a production ready machine learning library.
//! This is a project that is still very much a work in progress.
